It presents cutting-edge thinking and professional reflection and is designed to be a source of ideas and approaches that can be adopted for application in the real world by those who recognize that conventional ways of defining and considering cyber-attack are insufficient. All of the authors believe that the term cyber must be urgently wrestled back from the technologists, cyber security professionals, consultancies and corporate silos that have hijacked it (seemingly without any resistance) and rendered the term essentially meaningless. The authors write from applied and often unique experiences in a range of commercial, consulting, state and defense environments. Many of the authors of this volume have direct experience of inflicting, reporting on and protecting organizations from such effects, and also have knowledge of taking the challenge to additional levels. Most consultancies, academics and experts dont live in the real world, are content with operating in the commoditised world of cyber-technical security and dont have the intellectual capacity to understand, engage with or monetize this more challenging reality. This book is intended to help organizations improve preparedness for the established cyber world reality.",

        "Description": "Cybersecurity refers to the measures taken to keep electronic information private and safe from damage or theft. It is also used to make sure these devices and data are not misused. Cybersecurity applies to both software and hardware, as well as information on the Internet, and can be used to protect everything from personal information to complex government systems. Cyber security is a distributed problem partly because of the distributed nature of the underlying infrastructure and partly because industries, government and individuals all come at it with different perspectives. Under these circumstances regulation is best attempted from the bottom up, and legalisation, especially in the area of criminal law, should be sharply focused. There is the need for distributed approaches instead of the more traditional single, concentrated approach. Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, computers, and data from attack, damage, and unauthorized access. Cybersecurity training teaches professionals to spot vulnerabilities, fend off attacks, and immediately respond to emergencies. The spread of modern information technologies has brought about considerable changes in the global environment, ranging from the speed of economic transactions to the nature of social interactions to the management of military operations in both peacetime and war. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and with new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. This book fully introduces the theory and practice of cyber security. Comprehensive in scope, it covers applied and practical elements, theory, and the reasons for the design of applications and security techniques. It treats both the management and engineering issues of computer security.",

        "Description": "This book presents a compendium of selected game- and decision-theoretic models to achieve and assess the security of critical infrastructures. Given contemporary reports on security incidents of various kinds, we can see a paradigm shift to attacks of an increasingly heterogeneous nature, combining different techniques into what we know as an advanced persistent threat. Security precautions must match these diverse threat patterns in an equally diverse manner; in response, this book provides a wealth of techniques for protection and mitigation. Much traditional security research has a narrow focus on specific attack scenarios or applications, and strives to make an attack “practically impossible.” A more recent approach to security views it as a scenario in which the cost of an attack exceeds the potential reward. This does not rule out the possibility of an attack but minimizes its likelihood to the least possible risk. The book follows this economic definition of security, offering a management scientific view that seeks a balance between security investments and their resulting benefits. It focuses on optimization of resources in light of threats such as terrorism and advanced persistent threats. Drawing on the authors’ experience and inspired by real case studies, the book provides a systematic approach to critical infrastructure security and resilience. Presenting a mixture of theoretical work and practical success stories, the book is chiefly intended for students and practitioners seeking an introduction to game- and decision-theoretic techniques for security. The required mathematical concepts are self-contained, rigorously introduced, and illustrated by case studies. The book also provides software tools that help guide readers in the practical use of the scientific models and computational frameworks.",

Would you like to know how to quickly create a cyber security plan for your business, without all of the technical jargon?Are you interested in pursuing a career in cyber security? Did you know that the average starting ENTRY salary of a cyber security professional ranges from $65,000 to $80,000 and jumps to multiple figures in a few years, depending on how far you want to go?Here is an interesting statistic, you are probably already compromised. Yes, at some point, one of your digital devices or activities has been hacked and your information has been sold to the \"underground market\". If you knew how bad the threats really are online, you would never go online again or you would do everything possible to secure your networks and devices, especially at home....and we're not talking about the ads that suddenly pop up and follow you around everywhere because you were looking at sunglasses for sale on Google or Amazon, those are re-targeting ads and they are totally legal and legitimate...We're talking about very evil malware that hides deep in your device(s) watching everything you do and type, just as one example among many hundreds of threat vectors out there.Why is This Happening Now?Our society has become saturated with internet-connected devices and trackers everywhere. From home routers to your mobile phones, most people AND businesses are easily hacked if targeted. But it gets even deeper than this; technology has advanced now to where most hacks are automated by emerging A.I., by software. Global hackers have vast networks and computers set up to conduct non-stop scans, pings and probes for weaknesses in millions of IP addresses and network domains, such as businesses and residential home routers.Check your router log and you'll see it yourself. Now most devices have firewalls but still, that is what's called an persistent threat that is here to stay, it's growing and we all need to be aware of how to protect ourselves starting today.In this introductory book, we will cover verified steps and tactics on how to increase the level of Cyber security in an organization and as an individual. It sheds light on the potential weak points which are used as infiltration points and gives examples of these breaches. We will also talk about cybercrime in a technologically-dependent world ..(Think IoT)Cyber security has come a long way from the days that hacks could only be perpetrated by a handful of individuals, and they were mostly done on the larger firms or government databases. Now, everyone with a mobile device, home system, car infotainment, or any other computing device is a point of weakness for malware or concerted attacks from hackers, real or automated.We have adopted anti-viruses and several firewalls to help prevent these issues to the point we have become oblivious to the majority of the attacks. The assistance of malware blocking tools allows our computing devices to fight thousands of attacks per day. Interestingly, cybercrime is a very lucrative industry, as has been proven by the constant investment by criminals on public information. It would be wise to pay at least half as much attention to your security.What are you waiting for, scroll to the top and click the \"Buy Now\" button to get started instantly!",

        "Description": "Cyber security research is one of the important areas in the computer science domain which also plays a major role in the life of almost every individual, enterprise, society and country, which this book illustrates. A large number of advanced security books focus on either cryptography or system security which covers both information and network security. However, there is hardly any books available for advanced-level students and research scholars in security research to systematically study how the major attacks are studied, modeled, planned and combated by the community. This book aims to fill this gap. This book provides focused content related to specific attacks or attack families. These dedicated discussions in the form of individual chapters covers the application or area specific aspects, while discussing the placement of defense solutions to combat the attacks. It includes eight high quality chapters from established security research groups worldwide, which address important attacks from theoretical (modeling) as well as practical aspects. Each chapter brings together comprehensive and structured information on an attack or an attack family. The authors present crisp detailing on the state of the art with quality illustration of defense mechanisms and open research problems. This book also covers various important attacks families such as insider threats, semantics social engineering attacks, distributed denial of service attacks, botnet based attacks, cyber physical malware based attacks, cross-vm attacks, and IoT covert channel attacks. This book will serve the interests of cyber security enthusiasts, undergraduates, post-graduates, researchers and professionals working in this field.",

        "Description": "As societies, governments, corporations and individuals become more dependent on the digital environment so they also become increasingly vulnerable to misuse of that environment. A considerable industry has developed to provide the means with which to make cyber space more secure, stable and predictable. Cyber security is concerned with the identification, avoidance, management and mitigation of risk in, or from, cyber space - the risk of harm and damage that might occur as the result of everything from individual carelessness, to organised criminality, to industrial and national security espionage and, at the extreme end of the scale, to disabling attacks against a country's critical national infrastructure. But this represents a rather narrow understanding of security and there is much more to cyber space than vulnerability, risk and threat. As well as security from financial loss, physical damage etc., cyber security must also be for the maximisation of benefit. The Oxford Handbook of Cyber Security takes a comprehensive and rounded approach to the still evolving topic of cyber security: the security of cyber space is as much technological as it is commercial and strategic; as much international as regional, national and personal; and as much a matter of hazard and vulnerability as an opportunity for social, economic and cultural growth",

The Secret to Cybersecurity closes that knowledge gap by using real-life examples to educate readers. It’s 2 a.m.—do you know who your child is online with? According to author Scott Augenbaum, between 80 to 90 percent of students say they do whatever they want on their smartphones—and their parents don’t have a clue. Is that you? What about your online banking passwords, are they safe? Has your email account or bank/debit card ever been compromised? In 2018, there were data breaches at several major companies—If those companies have your credit or debit information, that affects you. There are bad people in the world, and they are on the internet. They want to hurt you. They are based all over the world, so they’re hard at “work” when even you’re sleeping. They use automated programs to probe for weaknesses in your internet security programs. And they never stop. Cybercrime is on the increase internationally, and it’s up to you to protect yourself. But how? The Secret to Cybersecurity is the simple and straightforward plan to keep you, your family, and your business safe. Written by Scott Augenbaum, a 29-year veteran of the FBI who specialized in cybercrimes, it uses real-life examples to educate and inform readers, explaining who/why/how so you’ll have a specific takeaway to put into action for your family. Learn about the scams, methods, and ways that cyber criminals operate—and learn how to avoid being the next cyber victim.",

Myriam Dunn Cavelty posits that cyber-threats are definable by their unsubstantiated nature. Despite this, they have been propelled to the forefront of the political agenda. Using an innovative theoretical approach, this book examines how, under what conditions, by whom, for what reasons, and with what impact cyber-threats have been moved on to the political agenda. In particular, it analyses how governments have used threat frames, specific interpretive schemata about what counts as a threat or risk and how to respond to this threat. By approaching this subject from a security studies angle, this book closes a gap between practical and theoretical academic approaches. It also contributes to the more general debate about changing practices of national security and their implications for the international community.",

        "Description": "Focusing on countermeasures against orchestrated cyber-attacks, Cyber Security Culture is research-based and reinforced with insights from experts who do not normally release information into the public arena. It will enable managers of organizations across different industrial sectors and government agencies to better understand how organizational learning and training can be utilized to develop a culture that ultimately protects an organization from attacks. Peter Trim and David Upton believe that the speed and complexity of cyber-attacks demand a different approach to security management, including scenario-based planning and training, to supplement security policies and technical protection systems. The authors provide in-depth understanding of how organizational learning can produce cultural change addressing the behaviour of individuals, as well as machines. They provide information to help managers form policy to prevent cyber intrusions, to put robust security systems and procedures in place and to arrange appropriate training interventions such as table top exercises. Guidance embracing current and future threats and addressing issues such as social engineering is included. Although the work is embedded in a theoretical framework, non-technical staff will find the book of practical use because it renders highly technical subjects accessible and links firmly with areas beyond ICT, such as human resource management - in relation to bridging the education/training divide and allowing organizational learning to be embraced. This book will interest Government officials, policy advisors, law enforcement officers and senior managers within companies, as well as academics and students in a range of disciplines including management and computer science.",

        "Authors": "James Shires",
        "Description": "Cybersecurity is a complex and contested issue in international politics. By focusing on the 'great powers'--the US, the EU, Russia and China--studies in the field often fail to capture the specific politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East, especially in Egypt and the GCC states. For these countries, cybersecurity policies and practices are entangled with those of long-standing allies in the US and Europe, and are built on reciprocal flows of data, capital, technology and expertise. At the same time, these states have authoritarian systems of governance more reminiscent of Russia or China, including approaches to digital technologies centred on sovereignty and surveillance. This book is a pioneering examination of the politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East. Drawing on new interviews and original fieldwork, James Shires shows how the label of cybersecurity is repurposed by states, companies and other organisations to encompass a variety of concepts, including state conflict, targeted spyware, domestic information controls, and foreign interference through leaks and disinformation. These shifting meanings shape key technological systems as well as the social relations underpinning digital development. But however the term is interpreted, it is clear that cybersecurity is an integral aspect of the region's contemporary politics.",

Derived from research, it places security management in a holistic context and outlines how the strategic marketing approach can be used to underpin cyber security in partnership arrangements. The book is unique because it integrates material that is of a highly specialized nature but which can be interpreted by those with a non-specialist background in the area. Indeed, those with a limited knowledge of cyber security will be able to develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject and will be guided into devising and implementing relevant policy, systems and procedures that make the organization better able to withstand the increasingly sophisticated forms of cyber attack. The book includes a sequence-of-events model; an organizational governance framework; a business continuity management planning framework; a multi-cultural communication model; a cyber security management model and strategic management framework; an integrated governance mechanism; an integrated resilience management model; an integrated management model and system; a communication risk management strategy; and recommendations for counteracting a range of cyber threats. Cyber Security Management: A Governance, Risk and Compliance Framework simplifies complex material and provides a multi-disciplinary perspective and an explanation and interpretation of how managers can manage cyber threats in a pro-active manner and work towards counteracting cyber threats both now and in the future.",

The Netherlands considers itself one of the leading ICT countries, promotes itself as ‘a safe place to do business’ and aspires to be the digital gateway of Europe. This report will first estimate the current and prospective size of the Dutch digital economy and the ICT sector, and later analyze how much the latter contributes to the national economy. Next, we provide a holistic overview of the current level of public and private investments in cybersecurity, followed by an analysis estimating the Dutch cybersecurity market by comparing different studies. Taking into account the 1,5% loss of its national GDP to cybercrime, which correlates well to the €10bn value loss through cyber risk in the Netherlands, the Dutch private sector, and especially the government, can invest more in cybersecurity to reduce the impact and damage cybercrime and –risks. In addition, there is a drastic increase in demand anticipated for cybersecurity experts and IoT developers. As a result, when this is solved, one might conclude that the investments in cybersecurity will exceed the 10% norm. This research is directed to the National Cyber Testbed Initiative of The Hague Security Delta (December 2016).",

        "Description": "Cybersecurity needs a change in communication. It is time to show the world that cybersecurity is an exciting and diverse field to work in. Cybersecurity is not only about hackers and technical gobbledygook. It is a diverse field of work with a lot of collaboration with other disciplines. Over the years, security professionals have tried different awareness strategies to promote their work and to improve the knowledge of their audience but without much success. Communication problems are holding back advances in in the field.Visual Communication for Cybersecurity explores the possibilities of visual communication as a tool to improve the communication about cybersecurity and to better connect with non-experts. Visual communication is useful to explain complex topics and to solve complex problems. Visual tools are easy to share through social media and have the possibility to reach a wide audience. When applied strategically, visual communication can contribute to a people-centric approach to security, where employees are encouraged to actively engage in security activities rather than simply complying with the policies.Cybersecurity education does not usually include communication theory or creative skills. Many experts think that it is not part of their job and is best left to the communication department or they think that they lack any creative talent. This book introduces communication theories and models, gives practical tips, and shows many examples. The book can support students in cybersecurity education and professionals searching for alternatives to bullet-point presentations and textual reports. On top of that, if this book succeeds in inspiring the reader to start creating visuals, it may also give the reader the pleasure of seeing new possibilities and improving their performance.",

        "Description": "The Routledge Handbook of International Cybersecurity examines the development and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) from the perspective of international peace and security. Acknowledging that the very notion of peace and security has become more complex, the volume seeks to determine which questions of cybersecurity are indeed of relevance for international peace and security and which, while requiring international attention, are simply issues of contemporary governance or development. The Handbook offers a variety of thematic, regional and disciplinary perspectives on the question of international cybersecurity, and the chapters contextualize cybersecurity in the broader contestation over the world order, international law, conflict, human rights, governance and development. The volume is split into four thematic sections: Concepts and frameworks; Challenges to secure and peaceful cyberspace; National and regional perspectives on cybersecurity; Global approaches to cybersecurity. This book will be of much interest to students of cybersecurity, computer science, sociology, international law, defence studies and International Relations in general.

        "Title": "Unsettled Topics Concerning Airworthiness Cybersecurity Regulation",
        "Authors": "Aharon David",
        "Description": "The certification process of the Boeing 787, starting in 2005, marked a watershed for airworthiness regulation. The “Dreamliner,” the first true “flying data center,” could no longer be certified for airworthiness ignoring “sabotage,” like the classic safety regulation for commercial passenger aircraft. Its extensive application of data networks, including enhanced external digital communication, forced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), for the first time, to set “Special Conditions” for cybersecurity. In the 15 years that ensued, airworthiness regulation followed suit, and all key rule-, regulation-, and standard-making organizations weighed in to establish a new airworthiness cybersecurity superset of legislation, regulation, and standardization. The resulting International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) resolutions, US and European Union (EU) legislations, FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations, and the DO-326/ED-202 set of standards are already the de-facto, and soon becoming the official, standards for legislation, regulation, and best practices, with the FAA already mandating it to a constantly growing extent for a few years now—and EASA adopting the set in its entirety in July 2020. This emerging superset of documents is now carefully studied by all relevant actors—including industry, regulators, and academia—as the aviation ecosystem moves forward with DO-326/ED-202 set training, gap analysis, and even with certification itself. This report suggests a deeper analysis of these sets of regulatory documents and their effects on the aviation sector as they gradually become the law of the land, starting with their expected effects on the aviation ecosystem, the issues they pose to supply chains, and the challenges they present to the airworthiness certification process itself. Then, this report examines the major DO-326/ED-202 set gaps, inherent dilemmas, and methodological uncertainties. For each such unsettled domain, six aspects are reviewed. Finally, practical solution-seeking processes are proposed, and some specific potential frameworks and solutions are pointed out whenever applicable. It is the intention of this report that these insights and observations would assist regulators, applicants, and standard makers through, at least, the 2020s with accommodating this new regulation and start adjusting it to emerging realities. NOTE: SAE EDGE™ Research Reports are intended to identify and illuminate key issues in emerging, but still unsettled, technologies of interest to the mobility industry. The goal of SAE EDGE™ Research Reports is to stimulate discussion and work in the hope of promoting and speeding resolution of identified issues.

In his book, Professor Chatterjee explains the challenges that organizations experience to protect information assets. The book sheds light on different aspects of cybersecurity including a history and impact of the most recent security breaches, as well as the strategic and leadership components that help build strong cybersecurity programs. This book helps bridge the gap between academia and practice and provides important insights that may help professionals in every industry.\" Mauricio Angee, Chief Information Security Officer, GenesisCare USA, Fort Myers, Florida, USA \"This book by Dave Chatterjee is by far the most comprehensive book on cybersecurity management. Cybersecurity is on top of the minds of board members, CEOs, and CIOs as they strive to protect their employees and intellectual property. This book is a must-read for CIOs and CISOs to build a robust cybersecurity program for their organizations.\" Vidhya Belapure, Chief Information Officer, Huber Engineered Materials & CP Kelco, Marietta, Georgia, USA Cybersecurity has traditionally been the purview of information technology professionals, who possess specialized knowledge and speak a language that few outside of their department can understand. In our current corporate landscape, however, cybersecurity awareness must be an organization-wide management competency in order to mitigate major threats to an organization’s well-being—and be prepared to act if the worst happens. With rapidly expanding attacks and evolving methods of attack, organizations are in a perpetual state of breach and have to deal with this existential threat head-on. Cybersecurity preparedness is a critical and distinctive competency, and this book is intended to help students and practitioners develop and enhance this capability, as individuals continue to be both the strongest and weakest links in a cyber defense system. In addition to providing the non-specialist with a jargon-free overview of cybersecurity threats, Dr. Chatterjee focuses most of the book on developing a practical and easy-to-comprehend management framework and success factors that will help leaders assess cybersecurity risks, address organizational weaknesses, and build a collaborative culture that is informed and responsive. Through brief case studies, literature review, and practical tools, he creates a manual for the student and professional alike to put into practice essential skills for any workplace.",

This book also provides the technical information regarding blockchain-oriented software, applications, and tools required for the researcher and developer experts in both computing and software engineering to provide solutions and automated systems against current security, trust and privacy issues in the cyberspace. Cybersecurity, trust and privacy (CTP) are pressing needs for governments, businesses, and individuals, receiving the utmost priority for enforcement and improvement in almost any societies around the globe. Rapid advances, on the other hand, are being made in emerging blockchain technology with broadly diverse applications that promise to better meet business and individual needs. Blockchain as a promising infrastructural technology seems to have the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity promoting decentralized cyberinfrastructure. Blockchain characteristics such as decentralization, verifiability and immutability may revolve current cybersecurity mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity, reliability, and integrity of data. Almost any article on the blockchain points out that the cybersecurity (and its derivatives) could be revitalized if it is supported by blockchain technology. Yet, little is known about factors related to decisions to adopt this technology, and how it can systemically be put into use to remedy current CTP’s issues in the digital world. Topics of interest for this book include but not limited to: Blockchain-based authentication, authorization and accounting mechanisms Applications of blockchain technologies in digital forensic and threat hunting Blockchain-based threat intelligence and threat analytics techniques Formal specification of smart contracts Automated tools for outsmarting smart contracts Security and privacy aspects of blockchain technologies Vulnerabilities of smart contracts Blockchain for securing cyber infrastructure and internet of things networks Blockchain-based cybersecurity education systems This book provides information for security and privacy experts in all the areas of blockchain, cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, forensics, smart contracts, computer systems, computer networks, software engineering, applied artificial intelligence for computer security experts, big data analysts, and decentralized systems.

The ultimate source is that computer owners lack adequate incentives to invest in security because they bear fully the costs of their security precautions but share the benefits with their network partners. In a world of positive transaction costs, individuals often select less than optimal security levels. The problem is compounded because the insecure networks extend far beyond the regulatory jurisdiction of any one nation or even coalition of nations. This book brings together the views of leading law and economics scholars on the nature of the cybersecurity problem and possible solutions to it. Many of these solutions are market based, but they need some help, either from government or industry groups or both. Indeed, the cybersecurity problem prefigures a host of 21st century problems created by information technology and the globalization of markets.",

        "Description": "Dependence on computers has had a transformative effect on human society. Cybernetics is now woven into the core functions of virtually every basic institution, including our oldest ones. War is one such institution, and the digital revolution's impact on it has been profound. The American military, which has no peer, is almost completely reliant on high-tech computer systems. Given the Internet's potential for full-spectrum surveillance and information disruption, the marshaling of computer networks represents the next stage of cyberwar. Indeed, it is upon us already. The recent Stuxnet episode, in which Israel fed a malignant computer virus into Iran's nuclear facilities, is one such example. Penetration into US government computer systems by Chinese hackers-presumably sponsored by the Chinese government-is another. Together, they point to a new era in the evolution of human conflict. In Cybersecurity and Cyerbwar: What Everyone Needs to Know, noted experts Peter W. Singer and Allan Friedman lay out how the revolution in military cybernetics occurred and explain where it is headed. They begin with an explanation of what cyberspace is before moving on to discussions of how it can be exploited and why it is so hard to defend. Throughout, they discuss the latest developments in military and security technology. Singer and Friedman close with a discussion of how people and governments can protect themselves. In sum, Cybersecurity and Cyerbwar is the definitive account on the subject for the educated general reader who wants to know more about the nature of war, conflict, and security in the twenty-first century.",

This book is a health check, a report card, on China’s cyber security system in the face of escalating threats from criminal gangs and hostile states. The book also offers an assessment of the effectiveness of China’s efforts. It lays out the major gaps and shortcomings in China’s cyber security policy. It is the first book to base itself around an assessment of China’s cyber industrial complex, concluding that China does not yet have one.

In the past decade, the number of cyberattacks against American targets has increased exponentially, and their impact has been more costly than ever before. A successful cyber-defense can only be mounted with the cooperation of both the government and the private sector, and only when individual corporate leaders integrate cybersecurity strategy throughout their organizations. A collaborative effort of the Board of Directors of the Internet Security Alliance, Fixing American Cybersecurity is divided into two parts. Part One analyzes why the US approach to cybersecurity has been inadequate and ineffective for decades and shows how it must be transformed to counter the heightened systemic risks that the nation faces today. Part Two explains in detail the cybersecurity strategies that should be pursued by each major sector of the American economy: health, defense, financial services, utilities and energy, retail, telecommunications, and information technology. Fixing American Cybersecurity will benefit industry leaders, policymakers, and business students. This book is essential reading to prepare for the future of American cybersecurity.",

        "Description": "Cybersecurity has been gaining serious attention and recently has become an important topic of concern for organizations, government institutions, and largely for people interacting with digital online systems. As many individual and organizational activities continue to grow and are conducted in the digital environment, new vulnerabilities have arisen which have led to cybersecurity threats. The nature, source, reasons, and sophistication for cyberattacks are not clearly known or understood, and many times invisible cyber attackers are never traced or can never be found. Cyberattacks can only be known once the attack and the destruction have already taken place long after the attackers have left. Cybersecurity for computer systems has increasingly become important because the government, military, corporate, financial, critical infrastructure, and medical organizations rely heavily on digital network systems, which process and store large volumes of data on computer devices that are exchanged on the internet, and they are vulnerable to “continuous” cyberattacks.

        "Description": "There is increasing pressure to protect computer networks against unauthorized intrusion, and some work in this area is concerned with engineering systems that are robust to attack. However, no system can be made invulnerable. Data Analysis for Network Cyber-Security focuses on monitoring and analyzing network traffic data, with the intention of preventing, or quickly identifying, malicious activity.Such work involves the intersection of statistics, data mining and computer science. Fundamentally, network traffic is relational, embodying a link between devices. As such, graph analysis approaches are a natural candidate. However, such methods do not scale well to the demands of real problems, and the critical aspect of the timing of communications events is not accounted for in these approaches.This book gathers papers from leading researchers to provide both background to the problems and a description of cutting-edge methodology. The contributors are from diverse institutions and areas of expertise and were brought together at a workshop held at the University of Bristol in March 2013 to address the issues of network cyber security. The workshop was supported by the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research.",

        "Description": "For many companies, their intellectual property can often be more valuable than their physical assets. Having an effective IT governance strategy in place can protect this intellectual property, reducing the risk of theft and infringement. Data protection, privacy and breach regulations, computer misuse around investigatory powers are part of a complex and often competing range of requirements to which directors must respond. There is increasingly the need for an overarching information security framework that can provide context and coherence to compliance activity worldwide. IT Governance is a key resource for forward-thinking managers and executives at all levels, enabling them to understand how decisions about information technology in the organization should be made and monitored, and, in particular, how information security risks are best dealt with. The development of IT governance - which recognises the convergence between business practice and IT management - makes it essential for managers at all levels, and in organizations of all sizes, to understand how best to deal with information security risk. The new edition has been full updated to take account of the latest regulatory and technological developments, including the creation of the International Board for IT Governance Qualifications. IT Governance also includes new material on key international markets - including the UK and the US, Australia and South Africa.",

        "Authors": "Taylor & Francis Group",
        "Description": "This book documents and explains civil defence preparations for national cyber emergencies in conditions of both peace and war. The volume analyses the escalating sense of crisis around state-sponsored cyber attacks that has emerged since 2015, when the United States first declared a national emergency in cyberspace. It documents a shift in thinking in the USA, from cooperative resilience-oriented approaches at national level to more highly regulated, state-led civil defence initiatives. Although the American response has been mirrored in other countries, the shift is far from universal. Civil defence strategies have come into play but the global experience of that has not been consistent or even that successful. Containing contributions from well-placed scholars and practitioners, this volume reviews a selection of national experiences (from the USA, Australia, India, China, Estonia, and Finland) and a number of key thematic issues (information weapons, alliance coordination, and attack simulations). These demonstrate a disconnect between the deepening sense of vulnerability and the availability of viable solutions at the national level. Awareness of this gap may ultimately lead to more internationally oriented cooperation, but the trend for now appears to be more conflictual and rooted in a growing sense of insecurity. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber security, homeland security, disaster management, and international relations, as well as practitioners and policy-makers.",

        "Authors": "Mely Caballero-Anthony, Alistair D.B. Cook",
        "Description": "Non-Traditional Security in Asia examines the critical security challenges faced by states and societies in Asia including health, food, water, natural disasters, internal conflict, forced migration, energy, transnational crime, and cyber security. Through the development of a comprehensive analytical framework that establishes the key ingredients to policy evaluation, the editors draw on a wide variety of experts to collaborate in investigating these crucial issues. This inclusive framework ensures that all voices are heard including those oftentimes under-represented and marginalized in society to ensure that academic and policy debates are well informed about the often complex and nuanced nature of these non-traditional security challenges. Through an investigation into these specific non-traditional security threats, Non-Traditional Security in Asia documents and evaluates many of the most pressing challenges faced by Asia today. The authors analyse the ways in which particular issues are addressed by the many stakeholders involved in the policy-making process, both within governments and across societies. The question of how these challenges are addressed across and between the different levels of global governance highlights the strengths and weakness that are directly attributable to policy successes and failures. It is through this layered and comprehensive approach, together with an evaluation of the role of stakeholders, which binds together the chapter contributions to this collection. The book undertakes an issue-specific chapter study of how Asian states and societies address these non-traditional security concerns from environmental adaptation and mitigation measures to conflict resolution. For each issue area, it identifies and explains the concerns of various policy communities, identifying the motivations behind some of the key decisions made to affect change or stabilize the status quo. Essentially it questions not only what a security issue is but also for whom the issue is important and the interaction this has with policy outcomes. With a focus on regional and global institutions as well as national and local ones, this collection illustrates the variety of stakeholders involved in non-traditional security concerns, and reflects on their relative importance in the decision-making process. Through a systematic evaluation of these non-traditional security issues by employing a comprehensive analytical framework, critical appreciation of the dynamics of the policy-making process surrounding issues of crucial national, regional and international significance in Asia are made. As a result of sharing these insights, the contributors provide the tools as well as a selection of issue-specific stakeholders to illuminate the key but complex characteristics of non-traditional security in Asia.",

        "Authors": "John Soldatos, James Philpot, Gabriele Giunta",
        "Description": "Modern critical infrastructures comprise of many interconnected cyber and physical assets, and as such are large scale cyber-physical systems. Hence, the conventional approach of securing these infrastructures by addressing cyber security and physical security separately is no longer effective. Rather more integrated approaches that address the security of cyber and physical assets at the same time are required. This book presents integrated (i.e. cyber and physical) security approaches and technologies for the critical infrastructures that underpin our societies. Specifically, it introduces advanced techniques for threat detection, risk assessment and security information sharing, based on leading edge technologies like machine learning, security knowledge modelling, IoT security and distributed ledger infrastructures. Likewise, it presets how established security technologies like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), pen-testing, vulnerability assessment and security data analytics can be used in the context of integrated Critical Infrastructure Protection. The novel methods and techniques of the book are exemplified in case studies involving critical infrastructures in four industrial sectors, namely finance, healthcare, energy and communications. The peculiarities of critical infrastructure protection in each one of these sectors is discussed and addressed based on sector-specific solutions. The advent of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is expected to increase the cyber-physical nature of critical infrastructures as well as their interconnection in the scope of sectorial and cross-sector value chains. Therefore, the demand for solutions that foster the interplay between cyber and physical security, and enable Cyber-Physical Threat Intelligence is likely to explode. In this book, we have shed light on the structure of such integrated security systems, as well as on the technologies that will underpin their operation.

        "Authors": "Hugo Loiseau, Daniel Ventre, Hartmut Aden",
        "Description": "The humanities and social sciences are interested in the cybersecurity object since its emergence in the security debates, at the beginning of the 2000s. This scientific production is thus still relatively young, but diversified, mobilizing at the same time political science, international relations, sociology , law, information science, security studies, surveillance studies, strategic studies, polemology. There is, however, no actual cybersecurity studies. After two decades of scientific production on this subject, we thought it essential to take stock of the research methods that could be mobilized, imagined and invented by the researchers. The research methodology on the subject \"cybersecurity\" has, paradoxically, been the subject of relatively few publications to date. This dimension is essential. It is the initial phase by which any researcher, seasoned or young doctoral student, must pass, to define his subject of study, delimit the contours, ask the research questions, and choose the methods of treatment. It is this methodological dimension that our book proposes to treat. The questions the authors were asked to answer were: how can cybersecurity be defined? What disciplines in the humanities and social sciences are studying, and how, cybersecurity? What is the place of pluralism or interdisciplinarity? How are the research topics chosen, the questions defined? How, concretely, to study cybersecurity: tools, methods, theories, organization of research, research fields, data ...? How are discipline-specific theories useful for understanding and studying cybersecurity? Has cybersecurity had an impact on scientific theories?",

        "Description": "This book is a practical guide to discovering and exploiting security flaws in web applications. The authors explain each category of vulnerability using real-world examples, screen shots and code extracts. The book is extremely practical in focus, and describes in detail the steps involved in detecting and exploiting each kind of security weakness found within a variety of applications such as online banking, e-commerce and other web applications. The topics covered include bypassing login mechanisms, injecting code, exploiting logic flaws and compromising other users. Because every web application is different, attacking them entails bringing to bear various general principles, techniques and experience in an imaginative way. The most successful hackers go beyond this, and find ways to automate their bespoke attacks. This handbook describes a proven methodology that combines the virtues of human intelligence and computerized brute force, often with devastating results. The authors are professional penetration testers who have been involved in web application security for nearly a decade. They have presented training courses at the Black Hat security conferences throughout the world. Under the alias \"PortSwigger\", Dafydd developed the popular Burp Suite of web application hack tools.",

These connections are not just about personal and professional relationships, but also about networks. Computer networks must share connections to enable us access to useful information we need online. While these connections help us create a bustling life online, they have also become a cause for worry and concern, hence the need to understand cyber security. In this book, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of cyber security. These are facts that form the foundation of your knowledge in cyber security. The knowledge you gain from this book will help you understand the need to enhance your security online. From office devices to your personal devices at home, you must be keen on securing your networks all the time. We use real life examples to show you how bad a security breach can be. Companies have suffered millions of dollars in damages in the past. Some of these examples are so recent that they may still be fresh in your mind. They help you reexamine your interactions online and question whether you should provide the information that a given website requests. These simple decisions can prevent a lot of damage in the long run. In cyber security today, policy is of the utmost importance. You must understand the policies that guide your interaction with different individuals and entities, especially concerning data security and sharing. This book introduces you to the GDPR policies that were passed in the EU as a guideline for how different entities interact with and handle data they hold in their databases. More importantly, you will also learn how to protect yourself in the event of an attack. Some attacks are multilayered, such that the way you respond to it might create a bigger problem or prevent one. By the end of this book, it is our hope that you will be more vigilant and protective of your devices and networks and be more aware of your networking environment.",

Featuring techniques not taught in any certification prep or covered by common defensive scanners, this book integrates social engineering, programming, and vulnerability exploits into a multidisciplinary approach for targeting and compromising high security environments. From discovering and creating attack vectors, and moving unseen through a target enterprise, to establishing command and exfiltrating data—even from organizations without a direct Internet connection—this guide contains the crucial techniques that provide a more accurate picture of your system's defense. Custom coding examples use VBA, Windows Scripting Host, C, Java, JavaScript, Flash, and more, with coverage of standard library applications and the use of scanning tools to bypass common defensive measures. Typical penetration testing consists of low-level hackers attacking a system with a list of known vulnerabilities, and defenders preventing those hacks using an equally well-known list of defensive scans. The professional hackers and nation states on the forefront of today's threats operate at a much more complex level—and this book shows you how to defend your high security network. Use targeted social engineering pretexts to create the initial compromise Leave a command and control structure in place for long-term access Escalate privilege and breach networks, operating systems, and trust structures Infiltrate further using harvested credentials while expanding control Today's threats are organized, professionally-run, and very much for-profit. Financial institutions, health care organizations, law enforcement, government agencies, and other high-value targets need to harden their IT infrastructure and human capital against targeted advanced attacks from motivated professionals. Advanced Penetration Testing goes beyond Kali linux and Metasploit and to provide you advanced pen testing for high security networks.",

It focuses on key ideas, institutional arrangements, on the publication of strategy papers, and importantly, on processes leading up to these strategy documents. The peculiarities of the Swiss political system, which influence the way cyber-security can be designed and practiced in Switzerland are considered, as well as the bigger, global influences and driving factors that shaped the Swiss approach to cyber-security. It shows that throughout the years, the most important influence on the Swiss policy-approach was the international level, or rather the developments of a cyber-security policy in other states. Even though many of the basic ideas about information-sharing and public-private partnerships were influenced by (amongst others) the US approach to critical infrastructure protection, the peculiarities of the Swiss political system has led to a particular “Swiss solution”, which is based on the federalist structures and subsidiary principles, characterized by stability and resilience to external shocks in the form of cyber-incidents. Cybersecurity in Switzerland will be a stimulating read for anybody interested in cyber-security policy, including students, researchers, analysts and policy makers. It contains not only specific material on an interesting case, but also a wealth of background information on different variations of cyber-security, as well as on information-sharing and public-private partnerships.",

        "Description": "Critical infrastructures are vital assets for public safety, economic welfare, and the national security of countries. The vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures have increased with the widespread use of information technologies. As Critical National Infrastructures are becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, their protection becomes a significant issue for organizations as well as nations. The risks to continued operations, from failing to upgrade aging infrastructure or not meeting mandated regulatory regimes, are considered highly significant, given the demonstrable impact of such circumstances. Due to the rapid increase of sophisticated cyber threats targeting critical infrastructures with significant destructive effects, the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures has become an agenda item for academics, practitioners, and policy makers. A holistic view which covers technical, policy, human, and behavioural aspects is essential to handle cyber security of critical infrastructures effectively. Moreover, the ability to attribute crimes to criminals is a vital element of avoiding impunity in cyberspace. In this book, both research and practical aspects of cyber security considerations in critical infrastructures are presented. Aligned with the interdisciplinary nature of cyber security, authors from academia, government, and industry have contributed 13 chapters. The issues that are discussed and analysed include cybersecurity training, maturity assessment frameworks, malware analysis techniques, ransomware attacks, security solutions for industrial control systems, and privacy preservation methods.",

Companies are investing an unprecedented amount of money to keep their data and assets safe, yet cyberattacks are on the rise--and the problem is worsening. No amount of technology, resources, or policies will reverse this trend. Only sound governance, originating with the board, can turn the tide. Protection against cyberattacks can't be treated as a problem solely belonging to an IT or cybersecurity department. It needs to cast a wide and impenetrable net that covers everything an organization does--from its business operations, models, and strategies to its products and intellectual property. And boards are in the best position to oversee the needed changes to strategy and hold their companies accountable. Not surprisingly, many boards aren't prepared to assume this responsibility. In A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity, Thomas Parenty and Jack Domet, who have spent over three decades in the field, present a timely, clear-eyed, and actionable framework that will empower senior executives and board members to become stewards of their companies' cybersecurity activities. This includes: Understanding cyber risks and how best to control them Planning and preparing for a crisis--and leading in its aftermath Making cybersecurity a companywide initiative and responsibility Drawing attention to the nontechnical dynamics that influence the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures Aligning the board, executive leadership, and cybersecurity teams on priorities Filled with tools, best practices, and strategies, A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity will help boards navigate this seemingly daunting but extremely necessary transition.",

You'll also learn which approaches are too risky to save, and are actually more damaging than a total lack of any security. Dangerous risk management methods abound; there is no industry more critically in need of solutions than cybersecurity. This book provides solutions where they exist, and advises when to change tracks entirely. Discover the shortcomings of cybersecurity's \"best practices\" Learn which risk management approaches actually create risk Improve your current practices with practical alterations Learn which methods are beyond saving, and worse than doing nothing Insightful and enlightening, this book will inspire a closer examination of your company's own risk management practices in the context of cybersecurity. The end goal is airtight data protection, so finding cracks in the vault is a positive thing—as long as you get there before the bad guys do. How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk is your guide to more robust protection through better quantitative processes, approaches, and techniques.",

Undetectable by firewalls and antivirus software, social engineering relies on human fault to gain access to sensitive spaces; in this book, renowned expert Christopher Hadnagy explains the most commonly-used techniques that fool even the most robust security personnel, and shows you how these techniques have been used in the past. The way that we make decisions as humans affects everything from our emotions to our security. Hackers, since the beginning of time, have figured out ways to exploit that decision making process and get you to take an action not in your best interest. This new Second Edition has been updated with the most current methods used by sharing stories, examples, and scientific study behind how those decisions are exploited. Networks and systems can be hacked, but they can also be protected; when the “system” in question is a human being, there is no software to fall back on, no hardware upgrade, no code that can lock information down indefinitely. Human nature and emotion is the secret weapon of the malicious social engineering, and this book shows you how to recognize, predict, and prevent this type of manipulation by taking you inside the social engineer’s bag of tricks. Examine the most common social engineering tricks used to gain access Discover which popular techniques generally don’t work in the real world Examine how our understanding of the science behind emotions and decisions can be used by social engineers Learn how social engineering factors into some of the biggest recent headlines Learn how to use these skills as a professional social engineer and secure your company Adopt effective counter-measures to keep hackers at bay By working from the social engineer’s playbook, you gain the advantage of foresight that can help you protect yourself and others from even their best efforts.

        "Description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have emerged as a unifying name for systems where cyber parts (i.e., the computing and communication parts) and physical parts are tightly integrated, both in design and during operation. Such systems use computations and communication deeply embedded in and interacting with human physical processes as well as augmenting existing and adding new capabilities. As such, CPS is an integration of computation, networking, and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. Artificial Intelligence Paradigms for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems focuses on the recent advances in Artificial intelligence-based approaches towards affecting secure cyber-physical systems. This book presents investigations on state-of-the-art research issues, applications, and achievements in the field of computational intelligence paradigms for CPS. Covering topics that include autonomous systems, access control, machine learning, and intrusion detection and prevention systems, this book is ideally designed for engineers, industry professionals, practitioners, scientists, managers, students, academicians, and researchers seeking current research on artificial intelligence and cyber-physical systems.",

        "Description": "We depend on information and information technology (IT) to make many of our day-to-day tasks easier and more convenient. Computers play key roles in transportation, health care, banking, and energy. Businesses use IT for payroll and accounting, inventory and sales, and research and development. Modern military forces use weapons that are increasingly coordinated through computer-based networks. Cybersecurity is vital to protecting all of these functions. Cyberspace is vulnerable to a broad spectrum of hackers, criminals, terrorists, and state actors. Working in cyberspace, these malevolent actors can steal money, intellectual property, or classified information; impersonate law-abiding parties for their own purposes; damage important data; or deny the availability of normally accessible services. Cybersecurity issues arise because of three factors taken together - the presence of malevolent actors in cyberspace, societal reliance on IT for many important functions, and the presence of vulnerabilities in IT systems. What steps can policy makers take to protect our government, businesses, and the public from those would take advantage of system vulnerabilities? At the Nexus of Cybersecurity and Public Policy offers a wealth of information on practical measures, technical and nontechnical challenges, and potential policy responses. According to this report, cybersecurity is a never-ending battle; threats will evolve as adversaries adopt new tools and techniques to compromise security. Cybersecurity is therefore an ongoing process that needs to evolve as new threats are identified. At the Nexus of Cybersecurity and Public Policy is a call for action to make cybersecurity a public safety priority. For a number of years, the cybersecurity issue has received increasing public attention; however, most policy focus has been on the short-term costs of improving systems. In its explanation of the fundamentals of cybersecurity and the discussion of potential policy responses, this book will be a resource for policy makers, cybersecurity and IT professionals, and anyone who wants to understand threats to cyberspace.",

The rise of cyberspace as a field of human endeavour is probably nothing less than one of the most significant developments in world history. Cyberspace already directly impacts every facet of human existence including economic, social, cultural and political developments, and the rate of change is not likely to stop anytime soon. However, the socio-political answers to the questions posed by the rise of cyberspace often significantly lag behind the rate of technological change. One of the fields most challenged by this development is that of 'national security'. The National Cyber Security Framework Manual provides detailed background information and in-depth theoretical frameworks to help the reader understand the various facets of National Cyber Security, according to different levels of public policy formulation. The four levels of government--political, strategic, operational and tactical/technical--each have their own perspectives on National Cyber Security, and each is addressed in individual sections within the Manual. Additionally, the Manual gives examples of relevant institutions in National Cyber Security, from top-level policy coordination bodies down to cyber crisis management structures and similar institutions.\"--P. 4 of cover.",

The first resource of its kind, this book provides authoritative guidance for real-world situations, and cross-functional solutions for enterprise-wide improvement. Beginning with an overview of counter-cyber evolution, the discussion quickly turns practical with design and implementation guidance for the range of capabilities expected of a robust cyber risk management system that is integrated with the enterprise risk management (ERM) system. Expert contributors from around the globe weigh in on specialized topics with tools and techniques to help any type or size of organization create a robust system tailored to its needs. Chapter summaries of required capabilities are aggregated to provide a new cyber risk maturity model used to benchmark capabilities and to road-map gap-improvement. Cyber risk is a fast-growing enterprise risk, not just an IT risk. Yet seldom is guidance provided as to what this means. This book is the first to tackle in detail those enterprise-wide capabilities expected by Board, CEO and Internal Audit, of the diverse executive management functions that need to team up with the Information Security function in order to provide integrated solutions. Learn how cyber risk management can be integrated to better protect your enterprise Design and benchmark new and improved practical counter-cyber capabilities Examine planning and implementation approaches, models, methods, and more Adopt a new cyber risk maturity model tailored to your enterprise needs The need to manage cyber risk across the enterprise—inclusive of the IT operations—is a growing concern as massive data breaches make the news on an alarmingly frequent basis. With a cyber risk management system now a business-necessary requirement, practitioners need to assess the effectiveness of their current system, and measure its gap-improvement over time in response to a dynamic and fast-moving threat landscape. The Cyber Risk Handbook brings the world's best thinking to bear on aligning that system to the enterprise and vice-a-versa. Every functional head of any organization must have a copy at-hand to understand their role in achieving that alignment.",

It is vital that cyber space continues to function effectively. Cyber space cuts across many of the threats and drivers outlined in the 2009 update to the \"National security strategy for the United Kingdom\" (Cm. 7590, ISBN 9780101759021): it reaches across international borders, is largely anonymous and the technology that underpins it continues to develop rapidly. The threats to those who use cyber space range from phishing to enable credit-card fraud through to corporate espionage. This cyber security strategy aims to reduce the risk for the UK's use of cyber space; exploit opportunities; improve knowledge, capabilities and decision-making. The Government will: establish a cross-government programme to address priority areas; work closely with the wider public sector, industry, civil liberties groups, the general public and with international partners; set up an Office of Cyber Security (OSC) to provide strategic leadership; create a Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) to monitor the health of cyber space and co-ordinate incident response, enable better understanding of attacks against UK networks and to provide information about the risks to business and the public.",

        "Authors": "Anand Handa",
        "Description": "Cyber security is one of the most critical problems faced by enterprises, government organizations, education institutes, small and medium scale businesses, and medical institutions today. Creating a cyber security posture through proper cyber security architecture, deployment of cyber defense tools, and building a security operation center are critical for all such organizations given the preponderance of cyber threats. However, cyber defense tools are expensive, and many small and medium-scale business houses cannot procure these tools within their budgets. Even those business houses that manage to procure them cannot use them effectively because of the lack of human resources and the knowledge of the standard enterprise security architecture. In 2020, the C3i Center at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur developed a professional certification course where IT professionals from various organizations go through rigorous six-month long training in cyber defense. During their training, groups within the cohort collaborate on team projects to develop cybersecurity solutions for problems such as malware analysis, threat intelligence collection, endpoint detection and protection, network intrusion detection, developing security incidents, event management systems, etc. All these projects leverage open-source tools, and code from various sources, and hence can be also constructed by others if the recipe to construct such tools is known. It is therefore beneficial if we put these recipes out in the form of book chapters such that small and medium scale businesses can create these tools based on open-source components, easily following the content of the chapters. In 2021, we published the first volume of this series based on the projects done by cohort 1 of the course. This volume, second in the series has new recipes and tool development expertise based on the projects done by cohort 3 of this training program. This volume consists of nine chapters that describe experience and know-how of projects in malware analysis, web application security, intrusion detection system, and honeypot in sufficient detail so they can be recreated by anyone looking to develop home grown solutions to defend themselves from cyber-attacks.",

        "Description": "“In this book, the authors adopt a refreshingly new approach to explaining the intricacies of the security and privacy challenge that is particularly well suited to today’s cybersecurity challenges. Their use of the threat–vulnerability–countermeasure paradigm combined with extensive real-world examples throughout results in a very effective learning methodology.” —Charles C. Palmer, IBM Research The Modern Introduction to Computer Security: Understand Threats, Identify Their Causes, and Implement Effective Countermeasures Analyzing Computer Security is a fresh, modern, and relevant introduction to computer security. Organized around today’s key attacks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures, it helps you think critically and creatively about computer security—so you can prevent serious problems and mitigate the effects of those that still occur. In this new book, renowned security and software engineering experts Charles P. Pfleeger and Shari Lawrence Pfleeger—authors of the classic Security in Computing—teach security the way modern security professionals approach it: by identifying the people or things that may cause harm, uncovering weaknesses that can be exploited, and choosing and applying the right protections. With this approach, not only will you study cases of attacks that have occurred, but you will also learn to apply this methodology to new situations. The book covers “hot button” issues, such as authentication failures, network interception, and denial of service. You also gain new insight into broader themes, including risk analysis, usability, trust, privacy, ethics, and forensics. One step at a time, the book systematically helps you develop the problem-solving skills needed to protect any information infrastructure.

        "Description": "In a world of increasing dependence on information technology, the prevention of cyberattacks on a nation's important computer and communications systems and networks is a problem that looms large. Given the demonstrated limitations of passive cybersecurity defense measures, it is natural to consider the possibility that deterrence might play a useful role in preventing cyberattacks against the United States and its vital interests. At the request of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Research Council undertook a two-phase project aimed to foster a broad, multidisciplinary examination of strategies for deterring cyberattacks on the United States and of the possible utility of these strategies for the U.S. government. The first phase produced a letter report providing basic information needed to understand the nature of the problem and to articulate important questions that can drive research regarding ways of more effectively preventing, discouraging, and inhibiting hostile activity against important U.S. information systems and networks. The second phase of the project entailed selecting appropriate experts to write papers on questions raised in the letter report. A number of experts, identified by the committee, were commissioned to write these papers under contract with the National Academy of Sciences. Commissioned papers were discussed at a public workshop held June 10-11, 2010, in Washington, D.C., and authors revised their papers after the workshop. Although the authors were selected and the papers reviewed and discussed by the committee, the individually authored papers do not reflect consensus views of the committee, and the reader should view these papers as offering points of departure that can stimulate further work on the topics discussed. The papers presented in this volume are published essentially as received from the authors, with some proofreading corrections made as limited time allowed.",

Organised around attacks and mitigations, the Pfleegers' new Analyzing Computer Security will attract students' attention by building on the high-profile security failures they may have already encountered in the popular media. Each section starts with an attack description. Next, the authors explain the vulnerabilities that have allowed this attack to occur. With this foundation in place, they systematically present today's most effective countermeasures for blocking or weakening the attack. One step at a time, students progress from attack/problem/harm to solution/protection/mitigation, building the powerful real-world problem solving skills they need to succeed as information security professionals. Analyzing Computer Security addresses crucial contemporary computer security themes throughout, including effective security management and risk analysis; economics and quantitative study; privacy, ethics, and laws; and the use of overlapping controls.

        "Description": "Security and law against the backdrop of technological development. Few people doubt the importance of the security of a state, its society and its organizations, institutions and individuals, as an unconditional basis for personal and societal flourishing. Equally, few people would deny being concerned by the often occurring conflicts between security and other values and fundamental freedoms and rights, such as individual autonomy or privacy for example. While the search for a balance between these public values is far from new, ICT and data-driven technologies have undoubtedly given it a new impulse. These technologies have a complicated and multifarious relationship with security. This book combines theoretical discussions of the concepts at stake and case studies following the relevant developments of ICT and data-driven technologies. Part I sets the scene by considering definitions of security. Part II questions whether and, if so, to what extent the law has been able to regulate the use of ICT and data-driven technologies as a means to maintain, protect or raise security, in search of a balance between security and other public values, such as privacy and equality. Part III investigates the regulatory means that can be leveraged by the law-maker in attempts to secure products, organizations or entities in a technological and multiactor environment. Lastly, Part IV, discusses typical international and national aspects of ICT, security and the law.",

        "Description": "This book provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of computer and Internet security, suitable for a one-term introductory course for junior/senior undergrad or first-year graduate students. It is also suitable for self-study by anyone seeking a solid footing in security – including software developers and computing professionals, technical managers and government staff. An overriding focus is on brevity, without sacrificing breadth of core topics or technical detail within them. The aim is to enable a broad understanding in roughly 350 pages. Further prioritization is supported by designating as optional selected content within this. Fundamental academic concepts are reinforced by specifics and examples, and related to applied problems and real-world incidents. The first chapter provides a gentle overview and 20 design principles for security. The ten chapters that follow provide a framework for understanding computer and Internet security. They regularly refer back to the principles, with supporting examples. These principles are the conceptual counterparts of security-related error patterns that have been recurring in software and system designs for over 50 years. The book is “elementary” in that it assumes no background in security, but unlike “soft” high-level texts it does not avoid low-level details, instead it selectively dives into fine points for exemplary topics to concretely illustrate concepts and principles. The book is rigorous in the sense of being technically sound, but avoids both mathematical proofs and lengthy source-code examples that typically make books inaccessible to general audiences. Knowledge of elementary operating system and networking concepts is helpful, but review sections summarize the essential background. For graduate students, inline exercises and supplemental references provided in per-chapter endnotes provide a bridge to further topics and a springboard to the research literature; for those in industry and government, pointers are provided to helpful surveys and relevant standards, e.g., documents from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.",

Don't allow your cybersecurity incident responses (IR) to fall short of the mark due to lack of planning, preparation, leadership, and management support. Surviving an incident, or a breach, requires the best response possible. This book provides practical guidance for the containment, eradication, and recovery from cybersecurity events and incidents. The book takes the approach that incident response should be a continual program. Leaders must understand the organizational environment, the strengths and weaknesses of the program and team, and how to strategically respond. Successful behaviors and actions required for each phase of incident response are explored in the book. Straight from NIST 800-61, these actions include: Planning and practicing Detection Containment Eradication Post-incident actions What You’ll Learn Know the sub-categories of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Understand the components of incident response Go beyond the incident response plan Turn the plan into a program that needs vision, leadership, and culture to make it successful Be effective in your role on the incident response team Who This Book Is For Cybersecurity leaders, executives, consultants, and entry-level professionals responsible for executing the incident response plan when something goes wrong",

Now he warns us of another threat, silent but equally dangerous. Cyber War is a powerful book about technology, government, and military strategy; about criminals, spies, soldiers, and hackers. It explains clearly and convincingly what cyber war is, how cyber weapons work, and how vulnerable we are as a nation and as individuals to the vast and looming web of cyber criminals. This is the first book about the war of the future—cyber war—and a convincing argument that we may already be in peril of losing it.",

The rise of cyberspace as a field of human endeavour is probably nothing less than one of the most significant developments in world history. Cyberspace already directly impacts every facet of human existence including economic, social, cultural and political developments, and the rate of change is not likely to stop anytime soon. However, the socio-political answers to the questions posed by the rise of cyberspace often significantly lag behind the rate of technological change. One of the fields most challenged by this development is that of 'national security'. The National Cyber Security Framework Manual provides detailed background information and in-depth theoretical frameworks to help the reader understand the various facets of National Cyber Security, according to different levels of public policy formulation. The four levels of government--political, strategic, operational and tactical/technical--each have their own perspectives on National Cyber Security, and each is addressed in individual sections within the Manual. Additionally, the Manual gives examples of relevant institutions in National Cyber Security, from top-level policy coordination bodies down to cyber crisis management structures and similar institutions.\"--Page 4 of cover.",

Important and cost-effective innovations can substantially increase cyber risk and the loss of intellectual property, corporate reputation and consumer confidence. Over the past several years, organizations around the world have increasingly come to appreciate the need to address cybersecurity issues from a business perspective, not just from a technical or risk angle. Cybersecurity for Business builds on a set of principles developed with international leaders from technology, government and the boardroom to lay out a clear roadmap of how to meet goals without creating undue cyber risk. This essential guide outlines the true nature of modern cyber risk, and how it can be assessed and managed using modern analytical tools to put cybersecurity in business terms. It then describes the roles and responsibilities each part of the organization has in implementing an effective enterprise-wide cyber risk management program, covering critical issues such as incident response, supply chain management and creating a culture of security. Bringing together a range of experts and senior leaders, this edited collection enables leaders and students to understand how to manage digital transformation and cybersecurity from a business perspective.",

        "Description": "This book is designed to introduce cyber security to children using analogy. The books highlights situations that a child might find themselves in whilst browsing on the Internet. In each scenario, there is a break in the story for the reader and the child to discuss the story and what they might learn from it. Relevant links are included at the end of each book to help parents and carers further their understanding of risk and protection on the Internet. It is intended that the parent or carer read these books with the child, stimulating discussions that will lay the groundwork for effective communication should the child encounter one of the risk scenarios represented by Nettie's adventures. Parents and carers of today's children often worry about the harm that might come to their children online, feeling powerless to protect them from some amorphous digital threat. Companies then sell them quick-fix solutions to be secretly imposed on their child's devices which limit screen-time, or which sites they might access. Imposing these limitations without attempts to communicate why such measures might be important do little to negate a child's resentment and improve their understanding. This failure of communication can result in the child learning to remove or work around restrictions they deign to be unfair or unnecessary. These are the kinds of predicaments the Nettie Project aims to correct before they can even occur.",

        "Description": "Information professionals have been paying more attention and putting a greater focus on privacy over cybersecurity. However, the number of both cybersecurity and privacy breach incidents are soaring, which indicates that cybersecurity risks are high and growing. Utilizing cybersecurity awareness training in organizations has been an effective tool to promote a cybersecurity-conscious culture, making individuals more cybersecurity-conscious as well. However, it is unknown if employees’ security behavior at work can be extended to their security behavior at home and personal life. On the one hand, information professionals need to inherit their role as data and information gatekeepers to safeguard data and information assets. On the other hand, information professionals can aid in enabling effective information access and dissemination of cybersecurity knowledge to make users conscious about the cybersecurity and privacy risks that are often hidden in the cyber universe. Cybersecurity for Information Professionals: Concepts and Applications introduces fundamental concepts in cybersecurity and addresses some of the challenges faced by information professionals, librarians, archivists, record managers, students, and professionals in related disciplines. This book is written especially for educators preparing courses in information security, cybersecurity, and the integration of privacy and cybersecurity. The chapters contained in this book present multiple and diverse perspectives from professionals in the field of cybersecurity. They cover such topics as: Information governance and cybersecurity User privacy and security online and the role of information professionals Cybersecurity and social media Healthcare regulations, threats, and their impact on cybersecurity A socio-technical perspective on mobile cybersecurity Cybersecurity in the software development life cycle Data security and privacy Above all, the book addresses the ongoing challenges of cybersecurity. In particular, it explains how information professionals can contribute to long-term workforce development by designing and leading cybersecurity awareness campaigns or cybersecurity hygiene programs to change people’s security behavior.",

Lively, insightful, and, often, alarming.”—Ewen MacAskill, Guardian On May 4, 2000, an email that read “kindly check the attached LOVELETTER” was sent from a computer in the Philippines. Attached was a virus, the Love Bug, and within days it had been circulated across the globe, paralyzing banks, broadcasters, and businesses in its wake, and extending as far as the UK Parliament and, reportedly, the Pentagon. The outbreak presaged a new era of online mayhem: the age of Crime Dot Com. In this book, investigative journalist Geoff White charts the astonishing development of hacking, from its conception in the United States’ hippy tech community in the 1970s, through its childhood among the ruins of the Eastern Bloc, to its coming of age as one of the most dangerous and pervasive threats to our connected world. He takes us inside the workings of real-life cybercrimes, drawing on interviews with those behind the most devastating hacks and revealing how the tactics employed by high-tech crooks to make millions are being harnessed by nation states to target voters, cripple power networks, and even prepare for cyber-war. From Anonymous to the Dark Web, Ashley Madison to election rigging, Crime Dot Com is a thrilling, dizzying, and terrifying account of hacking, past and present, what the future has in store, and how we might protect ourselves from it.",

        "Description": "Any organization with valuable data has been or will be attacked, probably successfully, at some point and with some damage. And, don't all digitally connected organizations have at least some data that can be considered \"valuable\"? Cyber security is a big, messy, multivariate, multidimensional arena. A reasonable \"defense-in-depth\" requires many technologies; smart, highly skilled people; and deep and broad analysis, all of which must come together into some sort of functioning whole, which is often termed a security architecture. Secrets of a Cyber Security Architect is about security architecture in practice. Expert security architects have dozens of tricks of their trade in their kips. In this book, author Brook S. E. Schoenfield shares his tips and tricks, as well as myriad tried and true bits of wisdom that his colleagues have shared with him. Creating and implementing a cyber security architecture can be hard, complex, and certainly frustrating work. This book is written to ease this pain and show how to express security requirements in ways that make the requirements more palatable and, thus, get them accomplished. It also explains how to surmount individual, team, and organizational resistance. The book covers: What security architecture is and the areas of expertise a security architect needs in practice The relationship between attack methods and the art of building cyber defenses Why to use attacks and how to derive a set of mitigations and defenses Approaches, tricks, and manipulations proven successful for practicing security architecture Starting, maturing, and running effective security architecture programs Secrets of the trade for the practicing security architecture Tricks to surmount typical problems Filled with practical insight, Secrets of a Cyber Security Architect is the desk reference every security architect needs to thwart the constant threats and dangers confronting every digitally connected organization.",

        "Authors": "Bradley Fowler, Kennedy Maranga",
        "Description": "Since 2000, many governments, parliaments, and ministries have worked diligently to define effective guidelines that safeguard both public and private sector information systems, as well as information assets, from unwanted cyberattacks and unauthorized system intrusion. While some countries manage successful cybersecurity public policies that undergo modification and revision annually, other countries struggle to define such policies effectively, because cybersecurity is not a priority within their country. For countries that have begun to define cybersecurity public policy, there remains a need to stay current with trends in cyber defense and information system security, information not necessarily readily available for all countries. This research evaluates 43 countries' cybersecurity public policy utilizing a SWOT analysis; Afghanistan, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Chili, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Dubai, Egypt, Estonia, European Union, Finland, Gambia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kosovo, Kuwait, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Samoa, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and Vietnam; to transparently discuss the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats encompassing each of these 43 countries' cybersecurity public policies. The primary vision for this title is to create an educational resource that benefits both the public and the private sectors. Without clarity on cybersecurity public policy, there remains a gap in understanding how to meet these needs worldwide. Furthermore, while more than 43 countries have already enacted cybersecurity public policy, many countries neglect translating their policy into English; this impacts the ability of all countries to communicate clearly and collaborate harmoniously on this subject matter. This book works to fill the “gap”, stop the spread of misinformation, and become the gateway to understanding what approaches can best serve the needs of both public and private sectors. Its goals include educating the public, and, in partnership with governments, parliaments, ministries, and cybersecurity public policy analysts, helping mitigate vulnerabilities currently woven into public and private sector information systems, software, hardware, and web interface applications relied upon for daily business activities.",

        "Authors": "Josephine Wolff",
        "Description": "What we can learn from the aftermath of cybersecurity breaches and how we can do a better job protecting online data. Cybersecurity incidents make the news with startling regularity. Each breach—the theft of 145.5 million Americans' information from Equifax, for example, or the Russian government's theft of National Security Agency documents, or the Sony Pictures data dump—makes headlines, inspires panic, instigates lawsuits, and is then forgotten. The cycle of alarm and amnesia continues with the next attack, and the one after that. In this book, cybersecurity expert Josephine Wolff argues that we shouldn't forget about these incidents, we should investigate their trajectory, from technology flaws to reparations for harm done to their impact on future security measures. We can learn valuable lessons in the aftermath of cybersecurity breaches. Wolff describes a series of significant cybersecurity incidents between 2005 and 2015, mapping the entire life cycle of each breach in order to identify opportunities for defensive intervention. She outlines three types of motives underlying these attacks—financial gain, espionage, and public humiliation of the victims—that have remained consistent through a decade of cyberattacks, offers examples of each, and analyzes the emergence of different attack patterns. The enormous TJX breach in 2006, for instance, set the pattern for a series of payment card fraud incidents that led to identity fraud and extortion; the Chinese army conducted cyberespionage campaigns directed at U.S.-based companies from 2006 to 2014, sparking debate about the distinction between economic and political espionage; and the 2014 breach of the Ashley Madison website was aimed at reputations rather than bank accounts.",

This guide is an instructional companion to the book Enterprise Cybersecurity: How to Build a Successful Cyberdefense Program Against Advanced Threats. The study guide will help you understand the book’s ideas and put them to work. The guide can be used for self-study or in the classroom. Enterprise cybersecurity is about implementing a cyberdefense program that will succeed in defending against real-world attacks. While we often know what should be done, the resources to do it often are not sufficient. The reality is that the Cybersecurity Conundrum—what the defenders request, what the frameworks specify, and what the budget allows versus what the attackers exploit—gets in the way of what needs to be done. Cyberattacks in the headlines affecting millions of people show that this conundrum fails more often than we would prefer. Cybersecurity professionals want to implement more than what control frameworks specify, and more than what the budget allows. Ironically, another challenge is that even when defenders get everything that they want, clever attackers are extremely effective at finding and exploiting the gaps in those defenses, regardless of their comprehensiveness. Therefore, the cybersecurity challenge is to spend the available budget on the right protections, so that real-world attacks can be thwarted without breaking the bank. People involved in or interested in successful enterprise cybersecurity can use this study guide to gain insight into a comprehensive framework for coordinating an entire enterprise cyberdefense program. What You’ll Learn Know the methodology of targeted attacks and why they succeed Master the cybersecurity risk management process Understand why cybersecurity capabilities are the foundation of effective cyberdefenses Organize a cybersecurity program's policy, people, budget, technology, and assessment Assess and score a cybersecurity program Report cybersecurity program status against compliance and regulatory frameworks Use the operational processes and supporting information systems of a successful cybersecurity program Create a data-driven and objectively managed cybersecurity program Discover how cybersecurity is evolving and will continue to evolve over the next decade Who This Book Is For Those involved in or interested in successful enterprise cybersecurity (e.g., business professionals, IT professionals, cybersecurity professionals, and students).

        "Title": "Learning by Practicing - Hack and Detect",
        "Authors": "Nik Alleyne",
        "Description": "This book leverages the Cyber Kill Chain to teach you how to hack and detect, from a network forensics perspective. Thus lots of packet and log analysis! There are lots of books that teach you how to hack. So the main purpose of this book is not really about hacking. However, the problem with many of those books, is they don''t teach you how to detect your activities. This means, you the reader have to go read another book, in order to understand the traces of network evidence, indicators of compromise (IoC), events of interests (EoI) and the breadcrumbs which are left behind, as part of your activities related to system compromise. Therefore, this book is truly meant to help you the reader detect sooner, whenever someone compromises your network. Remember, it is not if you will be compromised but when. This statement is assuming you have not already been compromised. To ensure you enjoy this book, it is written from the perspective of storytelling. While most technology related books are done from a how-to guide style, this one is not. However, the objectives remain the same. I believe tying the technical material in with a story, will add more context, make the message clearer and the learning process easier. An important note, as Neysa (Threat Actor) hacks, she plans to use the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain model as her framework. By leveraging the Cyber Kill Chain, she anticipates she can operate similar to an advanced persistent threat (APT). Where possible, she will follow the model exactly as it is. However, where needed, she may deviate while still being focused on achieving the actions and objectives as identified by the Cyber Kill Chain. For each of the attacks Neysa (Threat Actor) performs, where possible, Nakia (newly hired Cybersecurity Ninja) will leverage her Cybersecurity Ninja awesomeness, to detect Neysa''s actions. More importantly, for each of the attacks that Nakia detects, she must provide answers to the who, what, when, where, why and how to Saadia, the owner of SecurityNik Inc. These are critical questions every incident handler must answer. Now, the reality is, in many cases you may not be able to tell \"why\" it happened, as you don''t typically know your adversaries motive. However, Nakia will do her best to provide the necessary guidance, thus ensuring she gives Saadia actionable intelligence to decide on the way forward. Here is why you should get this book. Nik''s approach to viewing both the attacker and defender''s side of the compromise is an amazing way to correlate the causes and consequences of every action in an attack. This not only helps the reader learn, but is entertaining and will cause readers to flip all around the book to make sure they catch every detail. Tyler Hudak, Information Security By showing both the offensive and defensive sides of an attack, Nik helps each side better understand how the other operates. Joe Schottman, SANS Advisory Board Member Hack and Detect provides a window into a modern day attack from an advanced persistent threat in an easy to follow story format. Nik walks through the Cyber Kill Chain from both an offensive perspective, showing tools and tricks an attacker would leverage, and a defensive perspective, highlighting the breadcrumbs which are left behind. By following along step by step with virtual machines the reader is able to obtain a greater understanding of how the attacks work in the real world and gain valuable insight into defending against them.

        "Description": "A powerful argument for new laws and policies regarding cyber-security, from the former US Secretary of Homeland Security. The most dangerous threat we-individually and as a society-face today is no longer military, but rather the increasingly pervasive exposure of our personal information; nothing undermines our freedom more than losing control of information about ourselves. And yet, as daily events underscore, we are ever more vulnerable to cyber-attack. In this bracing book, Michael Chertoff makes clear that our laws and policies surrounding the protection of personal information, written for an earlier time, need to be completely overhauled in the Internet era. On the one hand, the collection of data-more widespread by business than by government, and impossible to stop-should be facilitated as an ultimate protection for society. On the other, standards under which information can be inspected, analysed or used must be significantly tightened. In offering his compelling call for action, Chertoff argues that what is at stake is not only the simple loss of privacy, which is almost impossible to protect, but also that of individual autonomy-the ability to make personal choices free of manipulation or coercion. Offering colourful stories over many decades that illuminate the three periods of data gathering we have experienced, Chertoff explains the complex legalities surrounding issues of data collection and dissemination today and charts a forceful new strategy that balances the needs of government, business and individuals alike.",

        "Authors": "Vinny Troia",
        "Description": "The skills and tools for collecting, verifying and correlating information from different types of systems is an essential skill when tracking down hackers. This book explores Open Source Intelligence Gathering (OSINT) inside out from multiple perspectives, including those of hackers and seasoned intelligence experts. OSINT refers to the techniques and tools required to harvest publicly available data concerning a person or an organization. With several years of experience of tracking hackers with OSINT, the author whips up a classical plot-line involving a hunt for a threat actor. While taking the audience through the thrilling investigative drama, the author immerses the audience with in-depth knowledge of state-of-the-art OSINT tools and techniques. Technical users will want a basic understanding of the Linux command line in order to follow the examples. But a person with no Linux or programming experience can still gain a lot from this book through the commentaries. This book’s unique digital investigation proposition is a combination of story-telling, tutorials, and case studies. The book explores digital investigation from multiple angles: Through the eyes of the author who has several years of experience in the subject. Through the mind of the hacker who collects massive amounts of data from multiple online sources to identify targets as well as ways to hit the targets. Through the eyes of industry leaders. This book is ideal for: Investigation professionals, forensic analysts, and CISO/CIO and other executives wanting to understand the mindset of a hacker and how seemingly harmless information can be used to target their organization. Security analysts, forensic investigators, and SOC teams looking for new approaches on digital investigations from the perspective of collecting and parsing publicly available information. CISOs and defense teams will find this book useful because it takes the perspective of infiltrating an organization from the mindset of a hacker. The commentary provided by outside experts will also provide them with ideas to further protect their organization’s data.",

Abagnale). Kevin Mitnick was the most elusive computer break-in artist in history. He accessed computers and networks at the world's biggest companies -- and no matter how fast the authorities were, Mitnick was faster, sprinting through phone switches, computer systems, and cellular networks. As the FBI's net finally began to tighten, Mitnick went on the run, engaging in an increasingly sophisticated game of hide-and-seek that escalated through false identities, a host of cities, and plenty of close shaves, to an ultimate showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down. Ghost in the Wires is a thrilling true story of intrigue, suspense, and unbelievable escapes -- and a portrait of a visionary who forced the authorities to rethink the way they pursued him, and forced companies to rethink the way they protect their most sensitive information. \"Mitnick manages to make breaking computer code sound as action-packed as robbing a bank.\" -- NPR",

It provides a psychosocial perspective on common cyberthreats affecting organizations, and presents practical solutions for leveraging employees’ attitudes and behaviours in order to improve security. Cybersecurity, as well as the solutions used to achieve it, has largely been associated with technologies. In contrast, this book argues that cybersecurity begins with improving the connections between people and digital technologies. By presenting a comprehensive analysis of the current cybersecurity landscape, the author discusses, based on literature and her personal experience, human weaknesses in relation to security and the advantages of pursuing a holistic approach to cybersecurity, and suggests how to develop cybersecurity culture in practice. Organizations can improve their cyber resilience by adequately training their staff. Accordingly, the book also describes a set of training methods and tools. Further, ongoing education programmes and effective communication within organizations are considered, showing that they can become key drivers for successful cybersecurity awareness initiatives. When properly trained and actively involved, human beings can become the true first line of defence for every organization.",

        "Description": "This book describes the methodologies and tools used to conduct social cyber forensic analysis. By applying these methodologies and tools on various events observed in the case studies contained within, their effectiveness is highlighted. They blend computational social network analysis and cyber forensic concepts and tools in order to identify and study information competitors. Through cyber forensic analysis, metadata associated with propaganda-riddled websites are extracted. This metadata assists in extracting social network information such as friends and followers along with communication network information such as networks depicting flows of information among the actors such as tweets, replies, retweets, mentions, and hyperlinks. Through computational social network analysis, the authors identify influential actors and powerful groups coordinating the disinformation campaign. A blended social cyber forensic approach allows them to study cross-media affiliations of the information competitors. For instance, narratives are framed on blogs and YouTube videos, and then Twitter and Reddit, for instance, will be used to disseminate the message. Social cyber forensic methodologies enable researchers to study the role of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the evolution of information campaign and coordination. In addition to the concepts and methodologies pertaining to social cyber forensics, this book also offers a collection of resources for readers including several datasets that were collected during case studies, up-to-date reference and literature surveys in the domain, and a suite of tools that students, researchers, and practitioners alike can utilize. Most importantly, the book demands a dialogue between information science researchers, public affairs officers, and policy makers to prepare our society to deal with the lawless “wild west” of modern social information systems triggering debates and studies on cyber diplomacy.",

        "Authors": "Aamo Iorliam",
        "Description": "This book reviews the use of digital surveillance for detecting, investigating and interpreting fraud associated with critical cyberinfrastructures in Nigeria, as it is well known that the country’s cyberspace and cyberinfrastructures are very porous, leaving too much room for cyber-attackers to freely operate. In 2017, there were 3,500 successful cyber-attacks on Nigerian cyberspace, which led to the country losing an estimated 450 million dollars. These cybercrimes are hampering Nigeria’s digital economy, and also help to explain why many Nigerians remain skeptical about Internet marketing and online transactions. If sensitive conversations using digital devices are not well monitored, Nigeria will be vulnerable to cyber-warfare, and its digital economy, military intelligence, and related sensitive industries will also suffer. The Nigerian Army Cyber Warfare Command was established in 2018 in order to combat terrorism, banditry, and other attacks by criminal groups in Nigeria. However, there remains an urgent need to produce digital surveillance software to help law enforcement agencies in Nigeria to detect and prevent these digitally facilitated crimes. The monitoring of Nigeria’s cyberspace and cyberinfrastructure has become imperative, given that the rate of criminal activities using technology has increased tremendously. In this regard, digital surveillance includes both passive forensic investigations (where an attack has already occurred) and active forensic investigations (real-time investigations that track attackers). In addition to reviewing the latest mobile device forensics, this book covers natural laws (Benford’s Law and Zipf’s Law) for network traffic analysis, mobile forensic tools, and digital surveillance software (e.g., A-BOT). It offers valuable insights into how digital surveillance software can be used to detect and prevent digitally facilitated crimes in Nigeria, and highlights the benefits of adopting digital surveillance software in Nigeria and other countries facing the same issues.",

        "Description": "This book begins with a broader discussion of cybercrime and attacks targeting ATMs and then focuses on a specific type of cybercrime named “ATM Hacking.” It discusses ATM Hacking from a more full scope of aspects, including technology, modus operandi, law enforcement, socio-economic and geopolitical context, and theory development. After unpacking a classic case of ATM Hacking and its modus operandi, implications for cybersecurity and prevention, intra- and inter-agency collaboration, and theory development are presented. This book also demonstrates the analysis of extensive qualitative data collected from a high-profile case in which European criminal group hacked into a London voice mail server belonging to a Taiwanese financial institution – First Commercial Bank,. Then it programmed dozens of ATMs to “spit out” millions of dollars of cash. The successful crackdown on this type of crime is rare, if not unique, while the number of similar crimes has increased enormously in recent years and the trend seem to continue unabatingly. Further, the implications go beyond a country or a continent. Intra- and inter-agency collaboration among players of law enforcement is essential to the case especially in the police context of “turf jealousies.” The authors seek to document the ways in which agencies collaborate, as well as the perceived benefits and challenges of cooperation. Whether the broader political and contextual climates in which these agencies operate, limit the extent to which they can cooperate. This book is useful as a reference for researchers and professionals working in the area of cybercrime and cybersecurity. University professors can also use this book as a case study for senior seminars or graduate courses.",

        "Authors": "Chris Moschovitis",
        "Description": "\"This is the book executives have been waiting for. It is clear: With deep expertise but in nontechnical language, it describes what cybersecurity risks are and the decisions executives need to make to address them. It is crisp: Quick and to the point, it doesn't waste words and won't waste your time. It is candid: There is no sure cybersecurity defense, and Chris Moschovitis doesn't pretend there is; instead, he tells you how to understand your company's risk and make smart business decisions about what you can mitigate and what you cannot. It is also, in all likelihood, the only book ever written (or ever to be written) about cybersecurity defense that is fun to read.\" —Thomas A. Stewart, Executive Director, National Center for the Middle Market and Co-Author of Woo, Wow, and Win: Service Design, Strategy, and the Art of Customer Delight Get answers to all your cybersecurity questions In 2016, we reached a tipping point—a moment where the global and local implications of cybersecurity became undeniable.

It seems that everything we touch is connected to the internet, from mobile phones and wearable technology to home appliances and cyber assistants. The more connected our computer systems, the more exposed they are to cyber attacks--attempts to steal data, corrupt software, disrupt operations, and even physically damage hardware and network infrastructures. In this volume of the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, cybersecurity expert Duane Wilson offers an accessible guide to cybersecurity issues for everyday users, describing risks associated with internet use, modern methods of defense against cyber attacks, and general principles for safer internet use. Wilson describes the principles that underlie all cybersecurity defense: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation (validating the source of information). He explains that confidentiality is accomplished by cryptography; examines the different layers of defense; analyzes cyber risks, threats, and vulnerabilities; and breaks down the cyber kill chain and the many forms of malware. He reviews some online applications of cybersecurity, including end-to-end security protection, secure ecommerce transactions, smart devices with built-in protections, and blockchain technology. Finally, Wilson considers the future of cybersecurity, discussing the continuing evolution of cyber defenses as well as research that may alter the overall threat landscape.",

A multidisciplinary group of leading researchers from cyber security, cognitive science, and decision science areas elab orate on the fundamental challenges facing the research community and identify promising solution paths. Today, when a security incident occurs, the top three questions security admin istrators would ask are in essence: What has happened? Why did it happen? What should I do? Answers to the ?rst two questions form the core of Cyber Situational Awareness. Whether the last question can be satisfactorily answered is greatly de pendent upon the cyber situational awareness capability of an enterprise. A variety of computer and network security research topics (especially some sys tems security topics) belong to or touch the scope of Cyber Situational Awareness. However, the Cyber Situational Awareness capability of an enterprise is still very limited for several reasons: • Inaccurate and incomplete vulnerability analysis, intrusion detection, and foren sics. • Lack of capability to monitor certain microscopic system/attack behavior. • Limited capability to transform/fuse/distill information into cyber intelligence. • Limited capability to handle uncertainty. • Existing system designs are not very “friendly” to Cyber Situational Awareness.",

When people think of programming languages, all that comes to their mind are C++, Python, Java etc, . People disregard SQL as a programming language because of its interface structure and limited functionality. However, they fail to understand that while C++, Python are third level programming languages, and hence more developed, it doesn't change the fact that SQL falls under the umbrella of programming languages.

In these pages, journalist Kim Zetter tells the whole story behind the world’s first cyberweapon, covering its genesis in the corridors of the White House and its effects in Iran—and telling the spectacular, unlikely tale of the security geeks who managed to unravel a top secret sabotage campaign years in the making. But Countdown to Zero Day also ranges beyond Stuxnet itself, exploring the history of cyberwarfare and its future, showing us what might happen should our infrastructure be targeted by a Stuxnet-style attack, and ultimately, providing a portrait of a world at the edge of a new kind of war.",

        "Description": "NEW YORK TIMES and WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER ONE OF THE WASHINGTON POST'S 10 BEST BOOKS OF 2015 One of the world’s leading authorities on global security, Marc Goodman takes readers deep into the digital underground to expose the alarming ways criminals, corporations, and even countries are using new and emerging technologies against you—and how this makes everyone more vulnerable than ever imagined. Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways, but there is an ominous flip side: our technology can be turned against us. Hackers can activate baby monitors to spy on families, thieves are analyzing social media posts to plot home invasions, and stalkers are exploiting the GPS on smart phones to track their victims’ every move. We all know today’s criminals can steal identities, drain online bank accounts, and wipe out computer servers, but that’s just the beginning. To date, no computer has been created that could not be hacked—a sobering fact given our radical dependence on these machines for everything from our nation’s power grid to air traffic control to financial services. Yet, as ubiquitous as technology seems today, just over the horizon is a tidal wave of scientific progress that will leave our heads spinning. If today’s Internet is the size of a golf ball, tomorrow’s will be the size of the sun. Welcome to the Internet of Things, a living, breathing, global information grid where every physical object will be online. But with greater connections come greater risks. Implantable medical devices such as pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt of electricity and a car’s brakes can be disabled at high speed from miles away. Meanwhile, 3-D printers can produce AK-47s, bioterrorists can download the recipe for Spanish flu, and cartels are using fleets of drones to ferry drugs across borders. With explosive insights based upon a career in law enforcement and counterterrorism, Marc Goodman takes readers on a vivid journey through the darkest recesses of the Internet. Reading like science fiction, but based in science fact, Future Crimes explores how bad actors are primed to hijack the technologies of tomorrow, including robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. These fields hold the power to create a world of unprecedented abundance and prosperity. But the technological bedrock upon which we are building our common future is deeply unstable and, like a house of cards, can come crashing down at any moment. Future Crimes provides a mind-blowing glimpse into the dark side of technological innovation and the unintended consequences of our connected world. Goodman offers a way out with clear steps we must take to survive the progress unfolding before us. Provocative, thrilling, and ultimately empowering, Future Crimes will serve as an urgent call to action that shows how we can take back control over our own devices and harness technology’s tremendous power for the betterment of humanity—before it’s too late.",

        "Authors": "Luis Ayala",
        "Description": "Learn how to detect and prevent the hacking of medical equipment at hospitals and healthcare facilities. A cyber-physical attack on building equipment pales in comparison to the damage a determined hacker can do if he/she gains access to a medical-grade network as a medical-grade network controls the diagnostic, treatment, and life support equipment on which lives depend. News reports inform us how hackers strike hospitals with ransomware that prevents staff from accessing patient records or scheduling appointments. Unfortunately, medical equipment also can be hacked and shut down remotely as a form of extortion. Criminal hackers will not ask for a $500 payment to unlock an MRI, PET or CT scan, or X-ray machine—they will ask for much more. Litigation is bound to follow and the resulting punitive awards will drive up hospital insurance costs and healthcare costs in general. This will undoubtedly result in increased regulations for hospitals and higher costs for compliance. Unless hospitals and other healthcare facilities take the steps necessary to secure their medical-grade networks, they will be targeted for cyber-physical attack, possibly with life-threatening consequences. Cybersecurity for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities is a wake-up call explaining what hackers can do, why hackers would target a hospital, the way hackers research a target, ways hackers can gain access to a medical-grade network (cyber-attack vectors), and ways hackers hope to monetize their cyber-attack. By understanding and detecting the threats, you can take action now—before your hospital becomes the next victim. What You Will Learn: Determine how vulnerable hospital and healthcare building equipment is to cyber-physical attack Identify possible ways hackers can hack hospital and healthcare facility equipment Recognize the cyber-attack vectors—or paths by which a hacker or cracker can gain access to a computer, a medical-grade network server, or expensive medical equipment in order to deliver a payload or malicious outcome Detect and prevent man-in-the-middle or denial-of-service cyber-attacks Find and prevent hacking of the hospital database and hospital web application Who This Book Is For: Hospital administrators, healthcare professionals, hospital & healthcare facility engineers and building managers, hospital & healthcare facility IT professionals, and HIPAA professionals",

        "Description": "Former hacker Kevin Poulsen has, over the past decade, built a reputation as one of the top investigative reporters on the cybercrime beat. In Kingpin, he pours his unmatched access and expertise into book form for the first time, delivering a gripping cat-and-mouse narrative—and an unprecedented view into the twenty-first century’s signature form of organized crime. The word spread through the hacking underground like some unstoppable new virus: Someone—some brilliant, audacious crook—had just staged a hostile takeover of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars from the US economy. The FBI rushed to launch an ambitious undercover operation aimed at tracking down this new kingpin; other agencies around the world deployed dozens of moles and double agents. Together, the cybercops lured numerous unsuspecting hackers into their clutches. . . . Yet at every turn, their main quarry displayed an uncanny ability to sniff out their snitches and see through their plots. The culprit they sought was the most unlikely of criminals: a brilliant programmer with a hippie ethic and a supervillain’s double identity. As prominent “white-hat” hacker Max “Vision” Butler, he was a celebrity throughout the programming world, even serving as a consultant to the FBI. But as the black-hat “Iceman,” he found in the world of data theft an irresistible opportunity to test his outsized abilities. He infiltrated thousands of computers around the country, sucking down millions of credit card numbers at will. He effortlessly hacked his fellow hackers, stealing their ill-gotten gains from under their noses. Together with a smooth-talking con artist, he ran a massive real-world crime ring. And for years, he did it all with seeming impunity, even as countless rivals ran afoul of police. Yet as he watched the fraudsters around him squabble, their ranks riddled with infiltrators, their methods inefficient, he began to see in their dysfunction the ultimate challenge: He would stage his coup and fix what was broken, run things as they should be run—even if it meant painting a bull’s-eye on his forehead. Through the story of this criminal’s remarkable rise, and of law enforcement’s quest to track him down, Kingpin lays bare the workings of a silent crime wave still affecting millions of Americans. In these pages, we are ushered into vast online-fraud supermarkets stocked with credit card numbers, counterfeit checks, hacked bank accounts, dead drops, and fake passports. We learn the workings of the numerous hacks—browser exploits, phishing attacks, Trojan horses, and much more—these fraudsters use to ply their trade, and trace the complex routes by which they turn stolen data into millions of dollars. And thanks to Poulsen’s remarkable access to both cops and criminals, we step inside the quiet, desperate arms race that law enforcement continues to fight with these scammers today. Ultimately, Kingpin is a journey into an underworld of startling scope and power, one in which ordinary American teenagers work hand in hand with murderous Russian mobsters and where a simple Wi-Fi connection can unleash a torrent of gold worth millions.",

Computer encryption is vital for protecting users, data, and infrastructure in the digital age. Using traditional computing, even common desktop encryption could take decades for specialized ‘crackers’ to break and government and infrastructure-grade encryption would take billions of times longer. In light of these facts, it may seem that today’s computer cryptography is a rock-solid way to safeguard everything from online passwords to the backbone of the entire internet. Unfortunately, many current cryptographic methods will soon be obsolete. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) predicted that quantum computers will soon be able to break the most popular forms of public key cryptography. The encryption technologies we rely on every day—HTTPS, TLS, WiFi protection, VPNs, cryptocurrencies, PKI, digital certificates, smartcards, and most two-factor authentication—will be virtually useless. . . unless you prepare. Cryptography Apocalypse is a crucial resource for every IT and InfoSec professional for preparing for the coming quantum-computing revolution. Post-quantum crypto algorithms are already a reality, but implementation will take significant time and computing power. This practical guide helps IT leaders and implementers make the appropriate decisions today to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

Using plain language and vivid examples, Abagnale reveals hundreds of tips, including: The best way to protect your phone from being hacked The only time you should ever use a debit card The one type of photo you should never post on social media The only conditions under which you should use WiFi networks at the airport The safest way to use an ATM With his simple but counterintuitive rules, Abagnale also makes use of his insider intel to paint a picture of cybercrimes that haven't become widespread yet.",

        "Description": "Understand the challenges of implementing a cyber warfare strategy and conducting cyber warfare. This book addresses the knowledge gaps and misconceptions of what it takes to wage cyber warfare from the technical standpoint of those with their hands on the keyboard. You will quickly appreciate the difficulty and complexity of executing warfare within the cyber domain. Included is a detailed illustration of cyber warfare against the backdrop of national and international policy, laws, and conventions relating to war. Waging Cyber War details technical resources and activities required by the cyber war fighter. Even non-technical readers will gain an understanding of how the obstacles encountered are not easily mitigated and the irreplaceable nature of many cyber resources. You will walk away more informed on how war is conducted from a cyber perspective, and perhaps why it shouldn't be waged. And you will come to know how cyber warfare has been covered unrealistically, technically misrepresented, and misunderstood by many. What You'll Learn Understand the concept of warfare and how cyber fits into the war-fighting domain Be aware of what constitutes and is involved in defining war and warfare as well as how cyber fits in that paradigm and vice versa Discover how the policies being put in place to plan and conduct cyber warfare reflect a lack of understanding regarding the technical means and resources necessary to perform such actions Know what it means to do cyber exploitation, attack, and intelligence gathering; when one is preferred over the other; and their specific values and impacts on each other Be familiar with the need for, and challenges of, enemy attribution Realize how to develop and scope a target in cyber warfare Grasp the concept of self-attribution: what it is, the need to avoid it, and its impact See what goes into establishing the access from which you will conduct cyber warfare against an identified target Appreciate how association affects cyber warfare Recognize the need for resource resilience, control, and ownership Walk through the misconceptions and an illustrative analogy of why cyber warfare doesn't always work as it is prescribed Who This Book Is For Anyone curious about warfare in the era of cyber everything, those involved in cyber operations and cyber warfare, and security practitioners and policy or decision makers.

        "Description": "While traveling the data highway through the global village, most people, if they think about it at all, consider privacy a non-forfeitable right. They expect to have control over the ways in which their personal information is obtained, distributed, shared, and used by any other entity. According to recent surveys, privacy, and anonymity are the fundamental issues of concern for most Internet users, ranked higher than ease-of-use, spam, cost, and security. Digital Privacy: Theory, Techniques, and Practices covers state-of-the-art technologies, best practices, and research results, as well as legal, regulatory, and ethical issues. Editors Alessandro Acquisti, Stefanos Gritzalis, Costas Lambrinoudakis, and Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati, established researchers whose work enjoys worldwide recognition, draw on contributions from experts in academia, industry, and government to delineate theoretical, technical, and practical aspects of digital privacy. They provide an up-to-date, integrated approach to privacy issues that spells out what digital privacy is and covers the threats, rights, and provisions of the legal framework in terms of technical counter measures for the protection of an individual’s privacy. The work includes coverage of protocols, mechanisms, applications, architectures, systems, and experimental studies. Even though the utilization of personal information can improve customer services, increase revenues, and lower business costs, it can be easily misused and lead to violations of privacy. Important legal, regulatory, and ethical issues have emerged, prompting the need for an urgent and consistent response by electronic societies. Currently there is no book available that combines such a wide range of privacy topics with such a stellar cast of contributors. Filling that void, Digital Privacy: Theory, Techniques, and Practices gives you the foundation for building effective and legal privacy protocols into your business processes.",

        "Description": "Stop manually analyzing binary! Practical Binary Analysis is the first book of its kind to present advanced binary analysis topics, such as binary instrumentation, dynamic taint analysis, and symbolic execution, in an accessible way. As malware increasingly obfuscates itself and applies anti-analysis techniques to thwart our analysis, we need more sophisticated methods that allow us to raise that dark curtain designed to keep us out--binary analysis can help. The goal of all binary analysis is to determine (and possibly modify) the true properties of binary programs to understand what they really do, rather than what we think they should do. While reverse engineering and disassembly are critical first steps in many forms of binary analysis, there is much more to be learned. This hands-on guide teaches you how to tackle the fascinating but challenging topics of binary analysis and instrumentation and helps you become proficient in an area typically only mastered by a small group of expert hackers. It will take you from basic concepts to state-of-the-art methods as you dig into topics like code injection, disassembly, dynamic taint analysis, and binary instrumentation. Written for security engineers, hackers, and those with a basic working knowledge of C/C++ and x86-64, Practical Binary Analysis will teach you in-depth how binary programs work and help you acquire the tools and techniques needed to gain more control and insight into binary programs. Once you've completed an introduction to basic binary formats, you'll learn how to analyze binaries using techniques like the GNU/Linux binary analysis toolchain, disassembly, and code injection. You'll then go on to implement profiling tools with Pin and learn how to build your own dynamic taint analysis tools with libdft and symbolic execution tools using Triton. You'll learn how to: - Parse ELF and PE binaries and build a binary loader with libbfd - Use data-flow analysis techniques like program tracing, slicing, and reaching definitions analysis to reason about runtime flow of your programs - Modify ELF binaries with techniques like parasitic code injection and hex editing - Build custom disassembly tools with Capstone - Use binary instrumentation to circumvent anti-analysis tricks commonly used by malware - Apply taint analysis to detect control hijacking and data leak attacks - Use symbolic execution to build automatic exploitation tools With exercises at the end of each chapter to help solidify your skills, you'll go from understanding basic assembly to performing some of the most sophisticated binary analysis and instrumentation. Practical Binary Analysis gives you what you need to work effectively with binary programs and transform your knowledge from basic understanding to expert-level proficiency.",

        "Description": "In a 1965 letter to Newsweek, French writer and academic Bernard Fall (1926-67) staked a claim as the 'Number One Realist' on the Vietnam War. This is the first book to study the thought of this overlooked figure, one of the most important experts on counterinsurgency warfare in Indochina. Nathaniel L. Moir's intellectual history analyses Fall's formative experiences: his service in the French underground and army during the Second World War; his father's execution by the Germans and his mother's murder in Auschwitz; and his work as a research analyst at the Nuremberg Trials. Moir demonstrates how these critical events shaped Fall's trenchant analysis of Viet Minh-led revolutionary warfare during the French-Indochina War and the early Vietnam War. In the years before conventional American intervention in 1965, Fall argued that--far more than anything in the United States' military arsenal--resolving conflict in Vietnam would require political strength, willpower, integrity and skill. Number One Realist illuminates Fall's study of political reconciliation in Indochina, while showing how his profound, humanitarian critique of war continues to echo in the endless conflicts of the present. It will challenge and change the way we think about the Vietnam War.",

Don't be so confident, says Misha Glenny, acclaimed journalist and author of the international bestseller McMafia. His explosive new book DarkMarket explores the rise of hackers and how -- through cyber crime, cyber warfare, and cyber industrial espionage -- they have supplanted traditional crime syndicates to become the new global mafia. Governments and the private sector are losing billions of dollars each year, fighting an ever-morphing, often invisible, and highly intelligent new breed of criminal: the hacker. By investigating the rise and fall of the criminal website DarkMarket, Glenny has uncovered the most vivid, alarming, and illuminating stories. He takes us from Google headquarters in California to Turkey's National Intelligence Ageny in Istanbul to the Internet cafes of Odessa, Ukraine, to introduce us to and explain all the players in this clandestine world -- the criminals, the geeks, the police, the security experts, and the victims -- and he places everyone and everything in a rich brew of politics, economics and history. Painstakingly researched and completely engrossing, DarkMarket takes us on a journey around the globe to unravel the biggest threats facing the twenty-first century. This is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about what is happening online and how to protect themselves.",
